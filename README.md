## Introductionüåª

- The ultimate resource to prepare for coding interviews. Everything you need, in one streamlined platform.
- Coding interview prep is a numbers game that many candidates lose. We've hand-picked 160 of the best coding interview Algorithms to truly prepare you.
- Algorithms are tough to learn on paper. Each and every one of our algorithm is accompanied by a visualizer to maximize learning.
- Understanding how much memory an algorithm uses and how fast it runs is exceedingly important. All of our explanations include a rigorous space-time complexity analysis.

1. Make sure to keep the UI consistent while adding a new feature.
2. When adding new packages, use the package version which is compatible with the new flutter 2 update.
3. Make sure that your code is well documented, especially in the tougher areas.
4. Maintain a uniform naming convention throughout the codebase.
5. If your code is being repetitive then refactor it to create a new widget for future use.
6. Make the code as modular as possible, separating the UI from the logic.
